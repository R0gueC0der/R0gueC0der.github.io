	    <h3>Student Of Law</h3>
	    <p>On 10 August 1888, Gandhi aged 18, left Porbandar for Mumbai, then known as Bombay. Upon arrival, he stayed with the local Modh Bania community while waiting for the ship travel arrangements. The head of the community knew Gandhi's father. After learning Gandhi's plans, he and other elders warned Gandhi that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in Western ways. Gandhi informed them of his promise to his mother and her blessings. The local chief disregarded it, and excommunicated him from his caste. But Gandhi ignored this, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to London. His brother saw him off. Gandhi attended University College, London which is a constituent college of University of London.</p>
	    <p>At UCL, he studied law and jurisprudence and was invited to enroll at Inner Temple with the intention of becoming a barrister. His childhood shyness and self withdrawal had continued through his teens, and he remained so when he arrived in London, but he joined a public speaking practice group and overcame this handicap to practice law.</p>

	    <h3>Political Activist</h3>
	    <p>In April 1893, Gandhi aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's cousin. He spent 21 years in South Africa, where he developed his political views, ethics and politics</p>
	    <p>Immediately upon arriving in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination because of his skin colour and heritage, like all colored people. He was not allowed to sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class coach. He sat in the station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.</p>
	    <p>When Gandhi arrived in South Africa, according to Herman, he thought of himself as "a Briton first, and an Indian second". However, the prejudice against him and his fellow Indians from British people that Gandhi experienced and observed deeply bothered him. He found it humiliating, struggling to understand how some people can feel honour or superiority or pleasure in such inhumane practices. Gandhi began to question his people's standing in the British Empire.</p>

	    <h3>Freedom Fighter</h3>
	    <p>Gandhi took leadership of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947 the British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.</p>
	    <p>In April 1918, during the latter part of World War I, the Viceroy invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi.[93] Gandhi agreed to actively recruit Indians for the war effort. In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants. In a June 1918 leaflet entitled "Appeal for Enlistment", Gandhi wrote "To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend ourselves, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them... If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army." He did, however, stipulate in a letter to the Viceroy's private secretary that he "personally will not kill or injure anybody, friend or foe."</p>

					<h3>Lawyer</h3></div>
					<p>Gandhi came from a poor family, and he had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family to consider law studies in London. In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, Harilal.</p> <p>His mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. However, Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.</p>

					<h3>Freedom Fighter</h3>
					<p>Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was the key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.</p>
					<p>Gandhi took leadership of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India.

					<div class="text">
						<p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi arrived in South Africa (SA) in 1893 as a legal representative of Indian traders in Durban. He faced the prevalent discrimination against people of colour in SA and decided to take up the fight against racial oppression. At the time, the Natal Assembly was about to pass a law disqualifying voters who were not of European origin and Gandhi became the leader of the Indian community to oppose the bill. Though temporarily delayed due to his efforts, the bill was ultimately passed in 1896. However, Natal Indian Congress, found in opposition to the bill, made the Indian community in SA a unified force. Also, Gandhi soon became a prominent campaigner for rights of the Asian community in SA.</p>

					His Satyagraha campaign in SA led to the 1914 Indian Relief Act</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>In 1906, a law was enacted in SA which required all male Asians in the Transvaal Province to be fingerprinted and carry a form of pass. In response Gandhi started the Satyagraha (‘truth-force’) campaign of non-violent resistance. He urged Indians to defy the new law and to suffer punishments for doing so. The campaign intensified in 1913 in protest against a £3 tax on ex-indentured Indians and because the state refused to recognise Indian marriages. Satyagraha was a 7 year struggle during which thousands of Indians were jailed, flogged and even shot. In 1914, due to public outcry over harsh treatment of peaceful protestors, the Indian Relief Act was passed which withdrew the £3 tax, customary marriages were recognised, and Indians were allowed to move freely into the Transvaal.</p>

He successfully led a non-violent tax revolt in Kheda.</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>In 1918, Kheda district in Gujarat, India was hit by floods and famine, leading to crop yields being less than a fourth. However, British government refused requests of the peasants for relief from taxes. Aided by the future Home Minister of India, Vallabhbhai Patel, Mahatma Gandhi initiated a campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue though the government threated to confiscate their land and warned that seized property wouldn’t be returned. Even with their property seized by the British government, a majority of the farmers stood behind Patel and Gandhi. After five months, in May 1918, the government suspended the tax for that year and the next, the increase in rate was reduced and all confiscated property was returned.</p>

Mahatma Gandhi won his first battle of civil disobedience in India at Champaran.</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>In 1915, Gandhi returned to India which was under British rule then. Champaran is a district in the Indian state of Bihar. The British forced farmers in the region to grow Indigo and other cash crops instead of food crops. Farmers sold these to mostly British landlords at extremely low fixed prices. This was coupled with bad weather conditions and harsh taxes leaving the famers in abject poverty. Gandhi arrived in Champaran in April 1917. Adopting strategy of non-violent civil disobedience, Gandhi led organized protests and strikes against the landlords. Finally, the British landlords signed an agreement granting more compensation and control to the farmers; and cancelling revenue hikes and collection until the famine ended. During this agitation, people began referring to Gandhi as Mahatma (Great Soul).</p>
